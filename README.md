# Indian Premier League (IPL) Data Analysis with MongoDB

Welcome to my IPL Data Analysis project using MongoDB! In this project, I have utilized the IPL dataset to explore various operations offered by MongoDB, including CRUD operations, text search, and aggregate operations. The dataset provides comprehensive information about the Indian Premier League, a professional Twenty20 cricket league in India.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains a wide range of information about IPL matches, teams, players, and more. It includes data such as:

- Match details: Match ID, date, venue, teams, outcome, etc.
- Team information: Team ID, name, abbreviations, home venue, captain, coach, etc.
- Player details: Player ID, name, nationality, role (batsman, bowler, all-rounder), etc.
- Batting and bowling statistics: Runs scored, wickets taken, strike rates, averages, etc.
- Tournament statistics: Points table, rankings, top performers, etc.

Please note that the dataset used for this project is for educational purposes only and may not reflect the most up-to-date IPL data. Make sure to refer to the original source for the latest information if needed.
